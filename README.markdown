| R2 | Payment Gateway Failure | Low | High | Tested APIs, fallback mechanism | Regular testing, API version tracking |
| R3 | Data Breach/Security Issue | Medium | High | HTTPS, hashed passwords, input validation | Penetration testing, logs monitoring |
| R4 | Incorrect Inventory Data | Medium | Medium | Admin panel for management | Manual checks, admin reports |
| R5 | Integration Delays | Medium | Medium | Agile with daily standups, task division | Track via GitHub/Trello |
| R6 | Feature Creep/Unclear Requirements | Medium | Medium | Document in SRS, early approvals | Changelog, SRS updates |
| R7 | Cross-Browser Compatibility | Medium | Medium | Responsive design, test on major browsers | BrowserStack, manual testing |
| R8 | Team Member Unavailability | Low | Medium | Backup roles, version control | Weekly updates, check-ins |
| R9 | Performance Lag in High Traffic | Low | High | Optimize code, lazy loading, compress images | Lighthouse, GTMetrix monitoring |
| R10 | Poor SEO/Product Visibility | Medium | Low | SEO tags, semantic HTML, sitemap | Google Search Console, SEO tools |

## Software Engineering Practices

- **Requirements:** Defined via a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlining functional (e.g., user login, checkout) and non-functional (e.g., performance, security) needs.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test cases for user registration, product catalog, cart, checkout, admin panel, performance, and security to ensure reliability.
- **Development Process:** Agile methodology with daily standups, task division, and progress tracking via GitHub/Trello.
- **Security:** HTTPS, bcrypt for passwords, protection against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF; 2FA for admins.
- **Documentation:** User and admin manuals, online help, and context-sensitive tooltips.
